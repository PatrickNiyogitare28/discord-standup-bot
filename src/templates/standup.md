***Example***
```
Yesterday I: Did some design work for a change, one webpage layout and then started to convert it to CSS and HTML.

Today I will: Carry on working on the design work, focusing mostly on HTML and CSS which gives me an opportunity to try and commit more CSS grid syntax to memory!

Any blockers: Understanding CSS grid syntax!
